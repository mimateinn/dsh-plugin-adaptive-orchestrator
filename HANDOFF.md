# Handoff

## In progress
- The user explicitly approved the specification and central-node icon direction on 2026-08-30.
- Implementation planning is in progress; code implementation has not started.

## Current state
- Repository is correctly located at H:\3 Apps\2026-08_dsh-adaptive-orchestrator\03 Src.
- Approved design candidate: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-adaptive-orchestrator-design.md.
- DSH Desktop 2.0.3 packaged seams were inspected and recorded with artifact SHA-256; official source checkout is still required for core-hook implementation.
- No tests/build baseline exists yet because no package scaffold has been implemented.
- Icon concept is outside Git at ..\02 Assets\ai-gen\icon-central-node-concept-v01.png and awaits user approval.

## Checklist
- [x] User explicitly approved the written design specification.
- [x] User approved the icon concept; SVG and 16/32/48/128/256 PNG exports exist under assets/icon.
- [ ] Create implementation plan.
- [ ] Scaffold one-command quality gate and characterization tests.
- [ ] Implement plugin core and UI.
- [ ] Implement/test thin DSH core hooks in an official source checkout.
- [ ] Run independent review and real GUI verification.
- [ ] Publish public GitHub repository.

## Known hazards
- The installed DSH app.asar path is a packaged file, not a source checkout.
- AgentTeams shared scheduling has no verified public hook in the inspected package.
- dsh-plugin-subscriptions source license was not verified; do not copy its code.
- Client changes do not update the existing GUI without affected Web rebuilds and refresh, unless dev:web is running from the same checkout.

## Independent review
- Review ID: spec-final-2026-08-30
- Reviewer: subagent run 230958d2-6376-4fa2-aa94-48ca43cadab0
- Revision: blob 6a21dd9a7ef8164025fe0c0ad57645177296965a; commit 13c1414
- Scope: deterministic implementation-plan readiness of the design specification
- Verdict: PASS
- Findings: no remaining implementation-plan blockers
- Re-review: not required unless the specification changes
